- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning more languages related to full-fledged programming, and frankly, I am inclined towards front-end programming, as I am learning within an educational system under the supervision of Meraki Academy in a camp that lasts for 700 hour and extends for five months intensively and with follow-up duration of up to 8 months.

- ðŸ‘¯ I am eager to graduate from this camp and work officially in this field besides my work as a civil engineer within the Housing Corporation and go far in this field. I imagine myself after the next five years inside large companies related to programming, so that my curiosity turned into a passion in the field of programming websites.

- <span>One of my work within this camp is to create a remote shopping website that serves customers professionally

- ðŸ¤” I am currently looking for a group of projects that support this stage so that I choose knowledge accurately and support my passion. I try to design integrated projects and then focus on the front-end side.
